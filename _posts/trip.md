## Dear friends and family,

As we count down the days until our wedding day, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on all the amazing trips and travels we have taken together as a couple. From exploring new cities to experiencing different cultures, our travels have brought us closer and created memories that will last a lifetime.

Some of our favorite trips include hiking through the mountains in National Parks, strolling through the charming streets of Manhattan, and relaxing at the coffee shop in Montreal. Each trip has allowed us to grow and learn from one another, and has shown us just how strong and unbreakable our love truly is.

We are so grateful to have each other by our side on these adventures, and we canâ€™t wait to continue traveling and creating new memories as husband and wife. We hope that our love for adventure and exploring the world together will inspire others to do the same.

Thank you for sharing in these memories with us, and we look forward to making many more in the years to come.

p.s. there is no filter on the Banff picture :P

Love,
Zoe & Jacob
